# Porting a Vector Calculator Application to LPC55S69 Microcontroller with Interface, Storage, and Calculation Acceleration

The project involves porting a vector calculator application, originally developed for PC, to an NXP LPC55S69 microcontroller to create a standalone device. This includes managing VT100 sequences for the command-line interface, integrating an SD card with a FAT file system, and connecting low-level functions to libc. Graphics display is optimized by using a second core to offload LCD display operations, with inter-core communication configured for synchronous and asynchronous execution. Additionally, the accelerometer enables interaction with display orientation, while SysTick-based time management provides precise timing functions. Finally, the project integrates PowerQuad to accelerate mathematical computations, such as cosine calculations and FFT transformations, for optimal performance
