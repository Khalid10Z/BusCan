# Introduction:
This project aims to develop a distributed sensor network using the CAN bus as the communication backbone. The goal was to retrieve data from multiple sensors on a host PC via a CAN bus. The sensors, connected to ST-Nucleo microcontrollers, transmit data via CAN frames for real-time display on a GUI.

# System Architecture:

3x STM32-Nucleo F411RE Boards
